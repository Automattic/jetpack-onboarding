Jetpack Start
=============

Jetpack Start is our attempt at exploring a better New User Experience flow when a user first sets up WordPress.

It is designed to be extensible, so that hosting companies that choose to bundle it can easily modify, add, or remove any of the steps that we've included by default.

Most of the code lives in the client, and uses [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) and Facebook's [Flux Dispatcher](https://github.com/facebook/flux) to manage the flow of data and UI updates. 

This initiative is currently being led by Daniel Walmsley [@gravityrail](http://github.com/gravityrail) and Luca Sartoni [@lucasartoni](https://github.com/lucasartoni), with design by Dan Hauk [@danhauk](https://github.com/danhauk).

Previous contributors who laid the foundation are Dave Martin [@growthdesigner](http://github.com/growthdesigner) and Miguel Lezama [@lezama](http://github.com/lezama).

Pull Requests and Issues are always welcome. :)

## Building

```bash
cd /path/to/jetpack-start
npm install -g grunt grunt-cli # if you don't have grunt
npm install                    # install local dependencies
grunt                          # by default, this watches your JS and SCSS files for changes and automatically rebuilds the client app
```

Directory structure:

- client - this is where you come to edit javascript
  - actions - Flux actions. These are called by components, and manage server-side data updates and telling the Dispatcher that an event/update has occurred.
  - components - React components, written as JSX
  - constants - Shared JS constants
  - dispatcher - the Flux App Dispatcher
  - stores - Flux stores, which receive callbacks from the Dispatcher, modify client data state and tell subscribed components to update themselves
  - utils - currently just a wrapper for jQuery.ajax that handles the WP way of rendering JSON errors.
  - jetpack-start.js - entry point for the JS client app
  - welcome-panel.js - entry point that configures and initialises the Welcome Panel on the dashboard.
- css - edit the SCSS files in here. CSS files are generated by grunt-sass (see above)
- font - just genericons
- js - the generated client JS bundle. DO NOT MODIFY. "grunt" handles this for you (see above)
